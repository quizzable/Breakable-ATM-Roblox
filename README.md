# Breakable-ATM-Roblox
A breakable ATM that breaks when punched and drops money

HOW TO USE 

To make the script work in Roblox Studio, follow these steps:

Open Roblox Studio and create a new game or open an existing one.
In the Explorer window on the left side of the screen, click on the "Insert" tab and then click on "Object" to insert a new object into the game.
Select the new object and rename it to "ATM" in the Properties window on the right side of the screen.
In the Explorer window, click on the "Workspace" folder to view its contents.
Right-click on the "Workspace" folder and select "Insert" and then "Script" to create a new script in the game.
Double-click on the new script to open it in the Script Editor window.
Copy the code from above and paste it into the Script Editor.
Click the "Play" button at the top of the screen to start the game.
When the game starts, you should be able to punch the ATM 5 times to drop money on the ground. Players can pick up the money by clicking on it.
Note: The ATM will not be able to be punched again until it refreshes, which takes 500 seconds. You can adjust this time by changing the refreshTime variable in the script.
